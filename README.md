# Some random programming activities
Some programming activities I recieve from friends, found on internet or something like that.

If, or some obscure reason, you want some information about anything, contact me at lucas.pellegrinelli@hotmail.com

Finally, don't expect good programming practices, documentation or code explanation from the code itself.

## Summary
